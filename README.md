# Homebrew Biotools

![BrewSci logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biomadeira/homebrew-biotools/master/images/brewsci-256x256.png)

These formulæ provide software for some tools used in my research
that are not covered by the default [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) taps.

## How do I install these formulæ?
`brew install biomadeira/biotools/<formula>`

Or `brew tap biomadeira/biotools` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/README.md).
